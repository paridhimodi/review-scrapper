# Review_scrapper

Web scraping is a technique using which the webpages from the internet are fetched and parsed
to understand and extract specific information similar to a human being. Web scrapping
consists of two parts:
• Web Crawling→ Accessing the webpages over the internet and pulling data from
them.
• HTML Parsing→ Parsing the HTML content of the webpages obtained through web
crawling and then extracting specific information from it.
Hence, web scrappers are applications/bots, which automatically send requests to websites and
then extract the desired information from the website output.

In this project I  tried to scrap the reviews from the website about the phone that I was planning to buy. And at the end I created the API using Flask and deployed it using on Heroku
